# Dice-Roller-Application-using-Python-and-Tkinter.
The Dice Roller Application is a simple GUI-based program built using Python and Tkinter, the standard GUI library in Python. The main purpose of this project is to simulate the rolling of a real dice with a visual interface instead of a console-based output.
